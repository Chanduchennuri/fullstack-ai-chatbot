# Build a Fullstack AI Chatbot with Redis, React, FastAPI and GPT

## Part 1 - Introduction - What we will be building

Building a **working** a fullstack application requires thinking about the so many moving parts, and making decisions that will be critical to the success of your app, such for example, what language do you use, what platform to deploy on, are you going to deploy a containerised software on a server, or make use of server-less functions to handle the backend, do you intend to use third-party APIs to handle complex parts of your application, like authentication or payments?, where do you store the data? added to all that, you'll also need to think about the user interface, design and usability of your application and much more. This is why complex large applications require a multifunctional development team, collaborating to build the app.

One of the best ways to learn how to develop full stack applications is to build projects that cover the end to end development process, from designing the architecture, to developing the API services, developing the user interface, and finally deploying your application. This tutorial will take your through each step using a project based example.
Some of the topics we will cover include:

- Building APIs with Python, FastAPI and WebSockets
- Build Real-time systems with Redis
- Build a Chat User Interface with React

**Important Note:**
_This is an intermediate full stack software development project and it requires some basic knowledge of Python and JavaScript. The project has been carefully divided into sections, to ensure that you can easily select the phase that is important to you in case you do not wish to code the full application._# **Build a Fullstack AI Chatbot with Redis, React, FastAPI and GPT**
